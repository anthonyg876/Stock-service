# Stock-service

Application that can be used to connect with a UF hosted database that contains information of stocks since their initial opening into the Nasdaq up until 2020.

# Running the application
To run the application, one needs to have a UF cise account to connect to the database to get the data. 

You also need to have Maven and jdk 11 to run the application.

If you have a CISE account, plug it into the application.properties file where the account and password are, ensure that you are connected to the UFL vpn,
and then you should be able to connect to the database. 

Next, run the other project which is called Stock-Salsa to get access to the front-end, designed by Daniel Grossman, Jesse Maki and myself. 

If you have any questions, email me @ agravier@ufl.edu.
